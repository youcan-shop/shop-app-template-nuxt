## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and a Package Manager (rec. [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)) installed ;

## Configuration Files

### youcan.app.json

This file describes your application to the YouCan App core and is generated by the YouCan CLI. Initially, it contains the name you choose and gets automatically updated with additional details once connected through the partner account.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to fill in the appropriate URLs where the app runs.

```json
{
  "name": "roi-simulator",
  "id": "<your-app-id>",
  "app_url": "http://localhost:3000/youcan",
  "redirect_urls": [
    "http://localhost:3000/youcan/oauth/callback"
  ],
  "oauth": {
    "scopes": [
      "*"
    ],
    "client_id": "<your-client-id>"
  }
}
```

### .env

Create a `.env` file by duplicating `.env.example` and updating it with your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** accordingly.

> You can find these credentials within Apps in your [Partner Dashboard](https://partners.youcan.shop/dashboard), where your app will appear with the necessary details.

```shell
YOUCAN_API_KEY=<your-client-id>
YOUCAN_API_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
YOUCAN_API_SCOPES=*
YOUCAN_API_REDIRECT=http://localhost:3000/youcan/oauth/callback
```

> Ensure the port your app is using matches the configuration.
